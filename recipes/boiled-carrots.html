    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Boiled carrots are simmered in butter and brown sugar for a delicious side dish that even my carrot-hating family loves! There are never any leftovers.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound baby carrots</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>  
      <ol>
        <li>Cook carrots in a large pot of boiling water until tender, about 8 to 10 minutes. Strain carrots, leaving just enough of the cooking water to cover the bottom of the pan; set carrots aside.</li>
        <li>Stir in brown sugar and butter; simmer and stir until butter melts. Return carrots to the pot and toss to coat. Cover and let sit for a few minutes to allow flavors to mingle.</li>
      </ol>
